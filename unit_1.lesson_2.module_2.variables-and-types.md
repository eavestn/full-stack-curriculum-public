# Unit 1, Lesson 2, Module 2: Variables And Types

## Introduction 

Variables and types is perhaps the most critical topic in any language. And - in JavaScript - there aren't any. Well, that's not actually true; but we'll learn why you can _sort of_ say that in this lesson. But, to start, let's dive into the basics. 

Programming languages - as discussed in Unit 1 Module 1 Lesson 1 _How Engineers Talk To Computers_ - are just ways for you and me to describe the world around us, like any language, whether that be Chinese, Greek, or English. And - in some sense - when we lookg a little more deeply at the way we describe things in languages, we are really only describing two things: [1] a thing; and [2] what that thing is doing: 

> Timmy is throwing the ball.

Yes, as with any language the whats, the whos, and the how-manies are more complex than those two simple things but, as you will see, you can accomplish a lot with just those two aspects of a language. This Module, _Variables And Types_ will focus specifically on the _thing_ aspect of the JavaScript language - something we will spend a lot of time on in the next three modules.

### Objectives

By the end of this Module, participants will be able to:

- [ ] clearly explain the purpose of a variable
- [ ] define a variable in JavaScript
- [ ] describe what Engineers mean when we say `type`.
- [ ] briefly speak to what JSON is (_more will be learned about JSON later_).

### purpose: storage of information

Starting with _describing_ a thing -- what aspects do we have? variables first (then eventually types) --> leading into more complex types.

### Variables

##### Quick Remark 

you may see `let` vs `const` vs `var` (don't worry about that now, we'll get into that, later)

### Types
